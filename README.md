             The Java app will make your PC** shutdown, sleep, hibernate, lock, 
             wake on lan (WoL) and detect your IP and MAC addresses automatically with no user intervention. 
            
            Simply download it and double click on the jar file. It will run on the background.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>My anti virus warns me about your java app, should I worry?</p>
        <p>I build apps for a living and I've got my name on it. 
        The Java app contains no viruses and has no malicious code embedded in 
        the code base. All it does is it opens a port on your PC and listens 
        for instructions from it's android app. That is it.</p>

        <h2>How do I run a Java app?</h2>
        <p>You need the latest JRE to run so make sure you have this running on your PC. You can either double click on the

        <h2>Intended audience?</h2>
        <p>Ideally developed for the novice user who doesn't know how networks are programmed.
         This app is not designed for an office environment. If you want to
        use it in an office environment, use it at your own risk.</p>
        
        <h2>Where can I get the android app?</h2>
        <p>It will be available on the play store soon and once it is available, I will link the app here.</p>
        
        <h2>Why do you have ads on your app?</h2>
        <p>It helps support my projects and further development into making useful 
        tools that people might use on a da to day basis. 
        I will condsider implementing a premium version with no ads in the future.</p>
        <h2>I get a warning from the browser that it might harm my PC?</h2>
        <p>This is normal. You are downloading a jar file from my personal site so browsers will be naturally wary of this. 
        Proceed to downloading the jar file without being concerned.</p> 
        <h2>File is called JavaSleep? So why isn't it called RemoteMyPC?</h2>
        <p>The initial release was only to make a PC sleep. Extra functionality 
        has been coded for other functions which are listed on the play store 
        which makes it more than just making a PC go to sleep. It can Lock, Hibernate, Sleep, Wake up on Lan and even launch a browser with a URL.</p>
        <h2>I have ideas, where can I send them?</h2>
        <p>There is a contact page on my site <a href="https://joselinares.me/contact.php"> here </a>.</p>
